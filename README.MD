Data wrangling and processing of geospatial data should be seamless 
so that earth scientists can focus on science. 

The purpose of PODPAC is to facilitate:

 * Access of data products
 * Subsetting of data products
 * Projecting and interpolating data products
 * Combining/compositing data products
 * Analysis of data products
 * Sharing of algorithms and data products
 * Use of cloud computing architectures (AWS) for processing
